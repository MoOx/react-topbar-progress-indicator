> `topbar` progress indicator as a React component

Will simply `show()` and `hide()` [topbar](https://github.com/buunguyen/topbar)
when the component is respectively mounted and unmounted.

**Since topbar is a singleton, using `<TopBarProgress />` multiples times will
take this in consideration. This means that `hide()` will only be called when
all `<TopBarProgress />` have been unmounted.**

For example, if you render 2 `<TopBarProgress />` and unmount one (eg: you are doing 2
async things and only once is done), `hide()` won't be called.
You will need to have both instances unmounted.

## Installation

```console
npm install react-topbar-progress-indicator
## or
yarn add react-topbar-progress-indicator
```

## Usage

```js
import TopBarProgress from "react-topbar-progress-indicator";

TopBarProgress.config({
  barColors: {
    "0": "#fff",
    "1.0": "#fff"
  },
  shadowBlur: 5
});

const YourThing = () => {
  return <div>{this.state.loading && <TopBarProgress />}</div>;
};
```
